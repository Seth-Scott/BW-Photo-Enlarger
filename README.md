The goal of this project is to modernize analog photography. Old photo enlargers use physical filters which are subject to color degregation, the timers can be imprecise, and results can be hard to repeat.

This project uses an Arduino Nano to simulate contrast filters and precise digital timers. This photo enlarger can be run off of a 5v barrel jack or a USB power supply/battery bank depending on your configuration. Simulated contrast filters range from 00 to 5 (and more), and can be switched on or off with a button. 

The project is nearly entirely 3d printed. Minimal fasteners are used and most connections are snapped together. All parts that aren't 3d printed are easily found at any hardware store, with the exception of the custom negative carrier, which is machined out of aluminum (I was able to source this online for about $20 US.)

The enlarger head can be removed without fasteners and can be used as a negative scanner with your smartphone/DSLR.
